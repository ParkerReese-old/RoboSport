<h1>RoboSport</h1>
This RoboSport repository contains all the requirements, design, and testing documentation leading up to the creation of the RoboSport game. You can find the root directory for the software program (made in Java) at RoboSport/doc/RoboSport. 
The goal was not to make a game, but rather to learn software development amongst a small group of people.
