GUI Explanation of "SetUp Amount of Players"
----------------------------------------------------
Once a game has been selected to start, the set # of players screen will pop up.

The "Set # of Players" screen will allow the user to choose how many teams they'll play within the game, and which teams will be controlled by a human or CPU.

The radial buttons at the top dictate the amount of teams within the game to be played. 
The playable options are selected via radial buttons. The options are 2, 3 or 6 teams.

Below this, an appropriate number of boxes depicting the teams are spawned. 
If '2 Teams' radial button is selected, two team boxes will appear. 
If '3 Teams' radial button is selected, three team boxes will appear. 
If '6 Teams' radial button is checked, six team boxes will appear.

Inside each team box will be two radial buttons, allowing the user to select HUMAN or CPU player.

Lastly, a button at the bottom right will start the game, taking the input from the radial buttons into the game master initializer.

Suggestions/Questions/Comments:
<S> Can we grey out CPU boxes when not in use? 
<Q> Does the start button call the "Setup Type Of Player" GUI Window? Or does double clicking the team box do it? 
<Q> Is the Window Frame GUI based, does it warrant discussion? Should I mention the X, -, + and drop arrow buttons?
