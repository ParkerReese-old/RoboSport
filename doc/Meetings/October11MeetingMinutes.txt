Meeting with TA - October 11th, 2016. 
+ User Driven Event architecture. (Described in detail, defend why we chose the specific architecture.)
+ First Architecture, then UML Diagrams (?)
+ How classes are interacting with each other.
+ No final decisions with absence of Dylan, but leaning toward event driven architecture. Fits really well with old material in req's document.  Design classes around that.
